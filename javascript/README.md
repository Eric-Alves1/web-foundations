# JavaScript 

This repository contains my JavaScript learning journey, organized to clearly separate **fundamentals**, **guided practice**, and **independent problem solving**.

The goal is to focus on understanding the language and building solid foundations.

---

## 📁 Structure

### `fundamentals/`
Small tests and experiments with core JavaScript concepts.

Used to:
- understand how the language works
- test ideas and behaviors
- practice basic syntax

---

### `guided/`
Guided exercises based on courses and documentation (such as MDN).

- Some structure or starter code was provided
- The logic and solutions were implemented by me
- Used to reinforce recently learned concepts

---

### `challenges/`
Problems solved **from scratch**, without starter code.

- Only the problem description
- Full solution designed and implemented by me
- Focus on logic and problem-solving

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is a record of my learning progress and a reference for review.

Larger or more complete projects are kept in separate repositories.
